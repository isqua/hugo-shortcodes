# Introduction

This is a curated collection of [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) [shortcodes](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/).

## What are shortcodes

> Shortcodes are simple snippets inside your content files calling built-in or custom templates.

On this website, you may find some pieces of code which may help you deliver content faster.

## How to use shortcodes

Before using a shortcode in your own Hugo website, you have to plug their code into your site. You can do it in two ways:

1. If you need only a few shortcodes, you may simply download their source files and put them into your `layouts/shortcodes` directory.
2. If you need dozens of them, itâ€™s better to attach this repository as a theme to your website.

Then you can easily use shortcodes in your content markdown files.
